     * @brief Utility class that measures FPS.
     *
     * FPSCounter is a utility class that keeps track of FPS (frames per second) of
     *  your application. It can be a simple performance measurement tool.
     *
     * Using FPSCounter is simple: if you're using GLWidget then all you have to do
     *  is calling fps() or fpsString() method to find out the current FPS. You can
     *  also call timeElapsed() to find out how much time has elapsed since last
     *  frame was rendered. This could be useful e.g. in animations where an object
     *  has a fixed speed and you multiply it by the elapsed time every frame to
     *  find out how much the object should be moved.
     *
     * If you don't use GLWidget then you need to call nextFrame() every time that
     *  another frame is rendered.
     *
     * The fps value is recalculated once a second.
     *
     * You can also use totalTimeElapsed() to find out how much time has elapsed
     *  since nextFrame() was called the very first time.
     *
     * @see GLWidget
