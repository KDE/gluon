             * @brief Camera class.
             *
             * Camera represents a virtual camera that can be used to view a scene.
             *
             * Camera's parameters can be specified in two ways:
             * Usually you will use the @ref setPosition, @ref setUp and either
             *  @ref setLookAt or @ref setDirection to set up camera position. The
             *  perspective transformation is specified using @ref setFoV, @ref setAspect
             *  and @ref setDepthRange methods.
             *
             * Alternatively, you can specify the modelview and projection matrices
             *  directly, using @ref setModelviewMatrix and @ref setProjectionMatrix
             *  methods.
             *
             * You can also use one way for the modelview matrix and another way for the
             *  projection matrix.
             * You can't mix the two modes though. If you use @ref setModelviewMatrix()
             *  and then @ref setPosition() then the setModelviewMatrix() call has no
             *  effect and modelview matrix will be calculated using specified position,
             *  lookat and up vectors.
             *
             * Camera also takes care of viewport handling. Instead of calling
             *  glViewport() directly, you should use @ref setViewport() and
             *  @ref applyViewport() methods.
             *
             * Finally, Camera has @ref project() and @ref unProject() methods for
             *  projecting points from world coordinates to window coordinates and vice
             *  versa. Obviously it only works if you don't modify OpenGL matrices or
             *  viewport manually but use the methods of this class instead.
