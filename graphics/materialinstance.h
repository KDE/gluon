     * to be rendered correctly. It does this by looking at its own
     * dynamic properties during a call to bind() and setting all uniform
     * variables related to those properties.
     *
     * The MaterialInstance gets the currently active camera from the
     * scene and uses that to set the view and projections matrices for the
     * vertex shader. The model matrix is set from within the Item class. You
     * will need to calculate the model-view-projection matrix from those
     * values in the vertex shader.
