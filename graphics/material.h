    * \brief Collection of techniques which describe how to render a surface.
    *
    * A material is an object containing a set of techniques.
    * Each technique describes a single way to render the surface
    * of an object.
    *
    * Materials cannot be directly rendered. Instead, you will need a
    * MaterialInstance of the Material to render it. This is because
    * the Material class is more like a code-generation tool. It
    * generates shader code at runtime and compiles it into an OpenGL
    * shader. The MaterialInstance then defines the values for the
    * shader's uniform and attribute values.
    *
    * MaterialInstances also control which technique is used to render
    * the material. In addition, each material has a default technqiue
    * which will be used if no override has been given.
    *
    * \see MaterialInstance
