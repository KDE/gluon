     * @author Benoit Jacob
     * @brief Enhanced text renderer.
     *
     * This class renders text inside a QGLWidget. It replaces and extends the functionality
     * of QGLWidget::renderText().
     *
     * Its advantages over the renderText() in Qt 4.2.3 are that it is much faster both at
     * render-time and at startup, consumes less memory, and does outlined text.
     * Its drawback is that its Unicode-safeness is
     * not perfect as superpositions of unicode characters aren't handled.
     *
     * Every QFont can be used, every character encodings supported by Qt can be used.
     *
     * To draw plain 2D text on top of the scene, do:
     * @code
     textRenderer.begin();
     textRenderer.draw( x1, y1, string1 );
     textRenderer.draw( x2, y2, string2 );
     textRenderer.draw( x3, y2, string3 );
     textRenderer.end();
     * @endcode
     *
     * To draw text as a transparent object inside the scene, do:
     * @code
     textRenderer.begin();
     textRenderer.draw( pos1, string1 );
     textRenderer.draw( pos2, string2 );
     textRenderer.draw( pos3, string3 );
     textRenderer.end();
     * @endcode
     *
     * In order to set the text color, please call glColor3f or glColor4f before
     * calling draw(). Of course you can
     * also call qglColor or Color::apply(). You can achieve semitransparent text at
     * no additional cost by choosing a semitransparent color.
     *
     * Please make sure that no relevant OpenGL state change occurs between
     * begin() and end(), except the state changes performed by the TextRenderer
     * itself. In other words, please avoid calling glSomething() between begin() and
     * end(), except if you are sure that this call won't result in a conflicting state
     * change. Of course calling glColor*() is allowed.
     *
     * If you experience rendering problems, you can try the following:
     * - disable some OpenGL state bits. For instance, TextRenderer automatically
     *   disables fog and lighting during rendering, because it doesn't work
     *   correctly with them enabled. There probably are other OpenGL state bits
     *   that have to be disabled, so if your program enables some of them, you
     *   might have to disable them before rendering text.
     * - if you experience poor font quality, meake sure that your GLWidget is using
     *   an antialiased font.
