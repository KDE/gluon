Things still to do for a decent creator workflow:

- Reordering of scene tree (In progress)
- Change Scene/Project file names when changing their respective objects in Creator.
- Changing empty asset handling to not parse the attributes as QString
- Fix the sanitze FQN on asset file write to not replace the extension's . with a _
- Text render component (maybe?)
- Fix delete asset crash
