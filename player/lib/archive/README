NOTE: This is a temporary format before we start using 7z/LZMA based archiving/compression.

I. FORMAT

The archive format we are using here is pretty simple, and contains the following-

1. First field is an int telling the number of files in the project

2. Next, *for each file*, there is a string telling the file's path, and next a qint64 telling its size.

3. After these, the raw file contents are appended

Example,

2
gameproject.gluon 45
assets/image.png 523

--binary data of gameproject.gluon--
--binary data of image.png--

II. Using Qt

use a QDataStream to read/write the headers, and then usual read/write functions to read/write binary data.
