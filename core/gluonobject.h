     * \brief Convenience-extended version of QObjects for use with Gluon
     *
     * The central object class for Gluon - it contains much convenience functionality
     * used throughout Gluon, specifically geared towards searching and the like.
     * It further extends QObject with extra functionality to help with certain specifics
     * for properties, that Qt's properties do not support, such as value borders and
     * steps for numerical values.
     *
     * <b>Subclassing</b>
     *
     * When implementing GluonObject subclasses in C++, please remember the following
     * items in your code:
     *
     * Definition (yourclassname.h):
    \code
    #include <gluonobject.h>

    namespace YourNamespace
    {
    class YourClassName : public GluonCore::GluonObject
    {

     *
     * When implementing such classes, please also ensure the following:
     *
     * - Mark all public functions which should be available from game code as a slot, or with the
     *   Q_INVOKABLE macro,
     * - Use the fully qualified type name for all properties (such as GluonInput::Mouse::MouseButton
     *   instead of just MouseButton or Mouse::MouseButton)
