     * \brief A simple explicit reference counting class.
     *
     * This class provides simple reference counting. It
     * does not use any specific pointer type to manage
     * reference counting, instead relying upon the user
     * of this class to increase and decrease the references
     * where necessary. It is mostly intended for situations
     * where you want to check whether it is safe to delete
     * something but do not want the burden of using non-
     * standard pointer classes.
     *
     * This class does not do any deletion when count() == 0 or
     * other "magic". It is purely intended for keeping track of
     * uses of an instance of an object.
