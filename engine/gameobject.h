     * \brief Represents the scene tree, third level of the GameObject hierarchy
     *
     * A GameObject is in essence just a translation object, meaning that it has a
     * position, a rotation and an orientation in 3D space. However, it also importantly
     * includes simple logic for attaching other bits of logic, as represented by the
     * Component class, which then attach more functionality to the GameObject.
     *
     * It is the third level of the GameObject hierarchy, and it can be seen as the
     * structure which makes up a scene tree (see also the Scene documentation).
     *
     * During the course of a game being played, the lifetime of a GameObject is like so:
     *
     * # GameObject is constructed on Scene load, and initialize() is called
     * # start() is called when game is started, or the current scene changes to the one containing this GameObject
     * # update() and draw() are called consecutively, at staggered intervals depending on which gameloop is used
     * # stop() is called when the game is stopped, or the current scene changes away
     * # cleanup() is called when the GameObject is destroyed
     */
