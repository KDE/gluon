     * The Asset class is a fat interface used to allow file access to GluonEngine based

     *
     * Assets are designed to be plugins, use the GLUON_ASSET_PLUGIN( metadatafile ) to
     * declare them as such. The metadata file is a JSON file as used by the Qt plugin
     * system. The following data can be contained in the JSON file:
     *
     * <code>
     * {
     *    "name": The name of the asset.
     *    "icon": The icon used for the asset.
     *    "category": The category of the asset.
     *    "mimeTypes": An array of strings with supported mime types.
     *    "templates": An associative array of objects describing the templates to use.
     *          Each entry should declare the name as key and the template as value.
     *    "actions": An array of objects describing the actions that can be
     *          performed on this asset. Each object is expected to have a name
     *          and method property, where method should be the name of a slot on the asset.
     * }
     * </code>
     *
     * Note that if you override supportedMimeTypes() or actions() and return
     * a non-empty list those lists will be used instead of the mime data from the
     * plugin.
