     * The GameProject class describes and contains a complete game project,
     * and all the meta information that goes with it, making it into a
     * complete game (minus engine, which is Gluon::Game and all the
     * Gluon::Component subclasses). As such it is the top level of the
     * GameObject hierarchy.
     *
     * The project's children (all assets, gameobjects and prefabs in the
     * project) are all found in the QObject hierarchy - they are simply
     * anchored by the QObject parent/child system.
     *
     * \note To find out which is the current scene in a game, use Game::currentScene
     *
     * <strong>The Gluon Game Bundle</strong>
     *
     * The structore of a game project as found on the disk is as follows:
     * - (gamename).gluon/ - This is a directory. Think of it as a bundle (NeXTStep style)
     *   - Assets/ - contains all the assets in a game
     *   - Cache/ - contains a number of directories, one for each asset which requires a data cache
     *   - Scenes/ - contains a file for each scene, each named (scenename).gluonscene
     *   - game.gluonproject
     *   - game.gluonmeta
     *   - screenshot.png
     *   - game.png - a 128x128 icon
     *   - game.ico - a Windows format icon file
     *   - .directory
     *   - desktop.ini
     *   - .ds_store -
     *
     * Naming conventions for the contents of the Assets and Scenes directories:
     *
     * - Filter all non-alphanumeric characters. (in short, everything not allowed in a javascript
     *   object name)
     * - All names are lower-cased
     *
     * The contents of the Cache directory should follow the following guidelines:
     *
     * - This directory contains a number of further directories, named for each asset which
     *   requires a cache
     * - The contents of each subdirectory are controlled by the asset (that is, the format is
     *   undefined), but for those creating assets it would be wise to follow the guidelines for
     *   Asset and Scene file names, to avoid problems with various operating systems.
     * - The contents will be re-generated when required, so the contents can be deleted if you
     *   should so wish, but this will increase loading times on the first access. However, if the
     *   generated files are very large, the cache for that item may be too big to distribute. Then
     *   it is good to know that the item can be safely deleted before publishing.
