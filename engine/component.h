     * \brief Adds functionality to GameObjects, is the final level in the GameObject hierarchy
     *
     * Component is a class which defines the required functionality for
     * implementing components for use with Gluon. A component is the place
     * where the vast majority of logic found in GluonEngine games exist. The six
     * most important functions for users are the virtual initialize(), start(),
     * update(), draw(), stop() and cleanup() functions. This class is the final
     * step in the GameObject hierarchy.
     *
     * Since a component is attached to exactly one GameObject, the position in
     * the world and anything else related to the GameObject can be found by
     * accessing gameObject() (for example finding other Components and such)
     *
     * Implementation checklist:
     * - Inherit from GluonEngine::Component
     * - Add the necessary macros as described in the GluonCore::GluonObject
     *   documentation
     * - Implement using QSharedData since GameObjects can be duplicated
     *   and the Components attached to it get duplicated along with it
     *   http://doc.trolltech.com/qshareddata.html
     * - Expose any properties to be visible in the editor through Q_PROPERTY
